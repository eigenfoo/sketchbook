- Summary:
  > `plotter.vision` is a single-serving website that lets you upload 3D STL
  > files, interactively position them, and then renders them with hidden
  > wireframe removal as well as coplanar triangle elimination and backface
  > culling. It's perfect for `#plottertwitter` and devices like the AxiDraw from
  > EMSL or polargraph whiteboard plotters.
